        "- fixed the ESRGAN upscaler by adding a tile feature to prevent large images from failing. Also added an option to use a folder on Colab vs the file browser in case some people have trouble with the file browser\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "v 2.5.3, last updated 9/13/22\n",
        "- fixed some bugs that were introduced to the previous version. Added clarity on the # of prompts required for the grid upscaler\n",
        "\n",
        "v 2.5.2, last updated 9/13/22:\n",
        "- added a small script to copy images from / content/HD/preProcessedGridSplits to the Google Drive since it was a requested feature\n",
        "\n",
        "v 2.5.1, last updated 9/08/22:\n",
        "- added the grid preview to the grid upscaler bonus tool\n",
        "- fixed some bugs like the face recogntion was requiring a \"/\" in the filename, but it seems the copy/paste shortcut doesn't paste that /. So it was failing\n",
        "- discovered a memory leak, so after generating a lot of grid upscales, the REAL ESRGAN has a permanent CUDA out of memory error. Seems only solution is to restart runtime from the beginning\n",
        "\n",
        "v 2.5.0, last updated 9/08/22:\n",
        "- this is a special update for me because I fixed the issues with facial recognition that were present in the previous version. now it finally works as I envisioned!\n",
        "- I also moved the variables storing the prompt templates and batch prompting to the installation cells so they're auto created at start. They're now converted into text files which are easy to manage and update than the old cells system. This makes things much more user friendly. I might add some settings presents to text files as well, then it's less bloated than it currently is\n",
        "\n",
        "v 2.4.0, last updated 9/05/22:\n",
        "- added Real ESRGAN to use by itself for upscaling images, or for use with face recognition\n",
        "- got the face recognition to work and it will output files to Google Drive\n",
        "- the final results of face recognition are not auto blended into the base image. How to do this cleanly is beyond me, so I just make use of masking the result with the base\n",
